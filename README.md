# Vx Fluent UI for Flutter

Based on Microsoft Fluent Design System and made using the help of Flutter VelocityX.

VxFluentUI is a Flutter component library that provides developers with controls that are part of the Fluent Design System.

VxFluentUI Flutter is still in the pre-alpha stages of development for both the components and the repo. We encourage anyone who is interested in getting an early glimpse of our plans to download and use our widgets, but please note that you may hit bumps along the way. Please leave us feedback or file issues if you run into bumps, and we will continue to improve the quality of the repo.
